<h2>Objective Statement and Summary</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Kyle Biddison, and at 24 years old, I bring a unique perspective to any team. Growing up in challenging circumstances has given me a deep appreciation for stability and consistency. I'm a laid-back, dependable individual who works well with others and can be social when the situation calls for it. At the same time, I know when to focus and get the job done efficiently. I want to be upfront about my past mistakes. I have a criminal record, but I have made significant progress in turning my life around. I am currently in a recovery program and have been out of trouble for the past year and a half. During my incarceration, I earned my GED and other certificates, and I'm committed to building a positive future for myself. My experiences have given me a unique perspective on life, and I'm excited to bring my skills and dedication to your organization. Please see my list of completed classes and seminars for more information on my qualifications. Thank you for considering me as a candidate.</p>
